# Class Homepage on AWS S3

## Overview
I created a simple class homepage using HTML and hosted it on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3). This repository contains the necessary files and information to demonstrate my work. The homepage includes an image, a small paragraph with content of my choice, and uses a W3.CSS template to enhance its appearance.

## Demo Steps

### 1. Accessing My Homepage:
- Open a web browser.
- Enter the following URL in the browser's address bar: [http://gmu-swe-645-aphill5.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com](http://gmu-swe-645-aphill5.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com).
- Ensure that my homepage loads correctly.

### 2. Navigating to the Error Page:
- Enter a non-existent resource, such as [http://gmu-swe-645-aphill5.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/nonexistent.html](http://gmu-swe-645-aphill5.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/nonexistent.html).
- Verify that the error page (`error.html`) is displayed with an appropriate error message.

### 3. Inspecting the HTML Code:
- I have attached in this zip file, the index.html, errors.html for your review
